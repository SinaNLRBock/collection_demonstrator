It&rsquo;s about creating a learning environment that supports understanding, motivation, and engagement. This module explores how didactic design and motivational strategies can help trainers in research data management (RDM) create meaningful learning experiences.</p> <p>Drawing on principles from The Carpentries and evidence-based pedagogy, participants will learn how to manage cognitive load, use formative assessment to identify misconceptions, and adapt instruction to the learners&rsquo; level of expertise. The module also emphasizes the importance of maintaining motivation - both for learners and trainers - and of using positive, inclusive language that fosters participation and confidence.</p> <p>By reflecting on their own teaching practices and engaging in practical exercises, participants will develop a deeper understanding of how to make RDM training sessions more effective, learner-centered, and enjoyable.</p> <p>In this module, you will:</p> <ul> <li> <ul> <li>Explore the relationship between expertise and teaching</li> <li>Identify and apply strategies to manage cognitive load</li> <li>Use formative assessments to support learning</li> <li>Recognize and address motivational factors in learners</li> <li>Create a positive and inclusive learning environment</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"
