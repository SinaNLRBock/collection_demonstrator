abstract: "<p><span dir=\"auto\"><span dir=\"auto\">In the NFDITalks, scientists from different disciplines present exciting topics around NFDI and research data management. <br><br>We talked talk about \"RDMTraining4NFDI &ndash; Developing a Cross-NFDI Training Service: Challenges, Findings, and Future Directions\". What does it need to effectively train research data management (RDM) multipliers? RDMTraining4NFDI, initiated within the NFDI, aims to establish a cross-consortia service for RDM training. This service is dedicated to developing a certification process that guarantees the quality, and standardisation of RDM training across the RDM community, ensuring alignment with the EOSC ecosystem. RDMTraining4NFDI provides training on didactics to strengthen RDM teaching skills across consortia. This talk will discuss the identified gaps, possible solutions to the challenges faced, initial insights into the results, and outline the next steps toward building a sustainable RDM training service for the NFDI.<br><br>You can watch the presentation here: https://www.youtube.com/live/3y7zXPcnbGo</span></span></p>"
