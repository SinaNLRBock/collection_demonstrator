abstract: "The past few years have seen a large number of initiatives and working groups that have de-veloped collections of training materials for different target groups and with different thematic focuses, learning objectives and competence profiles in the field of Research Data Manage-ment (RDM). It is hard to keep track: Which materials and content are relevant for whom? How can generic content be adapted to subject-specific needs? Which training formats are suitable for which target group? And how can learning units be certified? The base service Research Data Management Training for NFDI (RDMTraining4NFDI) [1] offers a modular collection of primarily existing fundamental RDM training materials, featur-ing documented and tested training formats and methods that take the Learning Objective Matrix [2] into account. Materials created in this project, such as best-practice guides, will be made freely available as Open Educational Resources (OER) under the CC-BY license and registered in DALIA [3] including metadata. By providing access to these materials, consortia can efficiently develop their own community-specific adaptations of the training and build ca-pacity quickly. In cooperation with four pilot consortia we collect existing (data type-specific) RDM teaching materials as well as learning objectives and how-to guidelines from the four NFDI consortia which form the foundation for a design document, with a future perspective of including mate-rials of all consortia. In addition to the actual teaching materials, various training formats, di-dactic concepts, learning resources and competency levels are identified and/or supplement-ed. This approach helps facilitate data-type-specific adaptation of the learning objectives ma-trix, support trainers in structuring and prioritizing their teaching content, and incorporate methods of engagement. This centralized support in instructional design, didactics and organi-zation structuring are partially based on the Instructor Training from The Carpentries [4] and the \"Train-the-Trainer Concept on Research Data Management\" [5] to ensure the use of evi-dence-based teaching methods. To assess the relevance, clarity as well as practicality of the training content and delivery methods after domain-specific adaption, three pilot training formats will be carried out with data stewards and RDM professionals: a flexible online workshop series, an intensive onsite Summer School and prospectively in the integration phase, a 10-month-long course building upon the experience gained from the RDM certificate course developed by TH Köln, ZB MED and fdm.nrw [6]. The results will serve as the basis for designing and creating data-type-specific training cours-es. Additionally, synergies with concepts (such as metadata schema for RDM [7] and Train-the-Trainer [8] of existing initiatives such as Dini/Nestor AG Forschungsdaten [9], EduBricks [10])) and other basic services have been build and further to be explored to enhance (exist-ing) training efforts across the NFDI landscape. Besides strengthening cooperation and networking within the NFDI and externally, we address the strong demand from the NFDI consortia [11] for standardized and certified training within the NFDI by exploring options for certifying RDM training. In our presentation, we will provide insights into the current collection and ongoing work, out-line our process for identifying certification options, and offer an outlook on the integration phase."
