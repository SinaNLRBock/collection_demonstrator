The description provided to participants is given below.</p> <blockquote> <p>Data protection can sometimes feel like a maze, full of rules, exceptions, and grey areas. This session is designed to make it clearer and more manageable for people working in research data management (RDM) and research support. Drawing on real examples and practical experience, we&rsquo;ll explore how GDPR principles can fit naturally into everyday research workflows.</p> <p>Together, we&rsquo;ll look at practical tools, common scenarios, and simple strategies that help teams stay compliant without losing focus on good research. Whether you&rsquo;re new to RDM or already supporting researchers, the session aims to give you the confidence and clarity to handle data protection in a realistic, hands-on way. Basically, to make you less nervous and more confident about finding the right resources and support, and to help make compliance a natural, regular part of your RDM journey.</p> </blockquote>"
