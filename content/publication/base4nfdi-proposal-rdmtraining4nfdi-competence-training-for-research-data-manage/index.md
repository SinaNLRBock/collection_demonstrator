abstract: "<p>Base4NFDI proposal RDMTraining4NFDI - Competence Training for Research Data Management</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Summary: The training of research data management (RDM) skills ‒ including the handling of data, metadata, software and machine learning models in line with FAIR and open science principles ‒ is fundamental to the success of the NFDI (National Research Data Infrastructure). In the initialisation phase, the proposed \"RDMTraining4NFDI\" basic service aims to provide four solutions to the NFDI consortia and their research communities: (1) modular teaching materials, didactic concepts and workflows for discipline-specific training programmes; (2) two formats (a workshop series and a Summer School) for training data stewards and trainers; (3) a certification concept to document the acquisition of RDM skills in different formats; (4) a communication network of experts in RDM training. The materials will be made freely available through public repositories as open educational resources (OERs) under the CC-BY licence and will be registered in the DALIA platform with a rich set of metadata. Subsequent phases will explore further options such as additional training formats, workflows for integrating new content into the collection and an accreditation process. The basic service will facilitate the efficient ongoing development and dissemination of high-quality training materials and will lay the groundwork for extensive, standardised and certified capacity building. In doing so, it will catalyse the broad adoption of FAIR principles and open science practices by the (German) research community.</p>"
