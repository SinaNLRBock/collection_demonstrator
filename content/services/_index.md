        Are you developing or delivering an RDM training? Beyond the content itself, the structure, methods, and your training skills are key to a successful training. We support you in delivering your training effectively by offering consultancy and training in skills and methodologies, drawing on approaches from [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) and the [Train-the-Trainer programme](https://zenodo.org/records/10122153).
