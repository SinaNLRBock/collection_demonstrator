        ## Compliance Status
        This website is partially compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 and the applicable European Standard EN 301 549 V2.1.2 (2018) due to the non-compliances and exemptions listed below. Identified non-compliances and exemptions are listed below.
        
        ## Non-Accessible Content
        * Some content is integrated into this website from a third-party source (for example, via frames) over which we do not have full authority and control. This content may be non-accessible or become non-accessible at any point in the future.
        * Some images may miss an alternative text (_alt_ attribute).
        * Some hyperlinked text in the footer may be too small and/or too closely spaced, going below a minimum touch target size for touch devices.
        * Some elements do not have sufficient color contrast ratio between the foreground text and its background, hence do not meet minimum contrast ratio threshold recommendations.
        * Some content may be non-accessible for screen readers and other assistive technology as the respective tests may have not been performed comprehensively for all scenarios.
